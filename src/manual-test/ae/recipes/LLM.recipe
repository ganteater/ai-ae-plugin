			This recipe demonstrates the usage of the LLM processor to interact with an AI language model.
			It initializes the LLM processor with an API key and sends a prompt to generate a short poem about the beauty of nature.
			The generated poem is stored in a property named 'responseText' and then output to the log with info level.
			This example showcases how Anteater can be used to integrate AI-powered text generation within interactive command workflows.
